Artificial intelligence by neural network from scratch using back propagation. This AI uses reinforcement learning to learn how to behave.

The red moving creature is supposed to get to the apple. It has to learn to move towards the apple by itself. 
The only inputs are the creature's coordinates and the coordinates of the apple.
The only output is the movement of the creature.
The creature gets points from moving closer to the apple.

First the creature doesnt understand what to do and moves to random directions. After being awarded points for moving in the right direction it begins to understand that it has to move towards the apple.
By trial and error it finally manages to get an accuracy of 96%
